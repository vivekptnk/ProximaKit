# ADR-008: Post-Filter Strategy for Filtered Search

## Status
Accepted (retrospective)

## Context
`search(query:k:efSearch:filter:)` accepts an optional `(@Sendable (UUID) -> Bool)` predicate. Two candidate strategies: post-filter (search normally, drop non-matching candidates) vs graph-aware filtering (consult the predicate during HNSW traversal so the beam expands toward matching nodes). The filter is an arbitrary closure over UUID, so it cannot be pre-indexed.

## Decision
Post-filter. HNSW runs its normal greedy descent and layer-0 beam search (ef candidates); the predicate is applied while materializing results from the layer-0 candidate set — alongside the tombstone check, before sorting and truncating to k (`HNSWIndex.search`; same shape in `QuantizedHNSWIndex`). `BruteForceIndex` applies the predicate during its full scan. `HybridIndex` passes the filter to both legs before fusion ("Applied on both legs before fusion"); `VectorStore` and `HybridVectorStore` forward it unchanged.

## Rationale
- Simplicity: no change to graph construction; one branch at result-collection time.
- No build-time cost: indexes stay filter-agnostic, so any predicate works against any existing index.
- Rejected candidates don't consume result slots — all ef layer-0 candidates are evaluated — so moderate selectivity still fills k. Callers can raise `efSearch` to compensate.

## Consequences
- Approximate indexes may return fewer than k results under selective filters: only the ef layer-0 candidates are considered, and the beam traversal itself is filter-blind. The documented contract is deliberately "Up to `k` results, sorted by distance (ascending)" (`VectorIndex.swift`, `QuantizedHNSWIndex.swift`, `VectorStore.swift`).
- `BruteForceIndex` is exact under any filter (filter applied across the full scan before top-k selection).
- Under highly selective filters (far fewer than ef matches in the beam), recall degrades and search work is spent evaluating candidates that get rejected.

## Upgrade Path
Graph-aware filtering: consult the predicate during traversal, letting the beam route through non-matching nodes while only matching nodes fill the result set. Acceptance criteria before merge: a selectivity benchmark at 10%, 1%, and 0.1% predicate pass rates, showing recall and result-count improvements over post-filter at equal latency budgets.

## Addendum: Graph-Aware Filtering Implemented for HNSWIndex

### Status
Implemented for `HNSWIndex` only. `QuantizedHNSWIndex`, `ScalarQuantizedHNSWIndex`, and `SparseIndex` keep the post-filter strategy described above; `BruteForceIndex` remains exact under any filter; `HybridIndex` inherits the upgrade on its dense leg because it forwards the filter unchanged. The public API is identical — `search(query:k:efSearch:filter:)` did not change shape.

### Strategy
- **Unfiltered queries (`filter == nil`) are untouched.** They run the original filter-blind `searchLayer` beam and result materialization — the graph-aware path adds zero work to the default case.
- **Filtered queries apply the predicate during the layer-0 beam** (`searchLayer0Filtered`). Rejected nodes — tombstoned slots (identity-based liveness, checked first so the predicate never sees deleted ids) or predicate failures — still join the candidate frontier, so the beam routes *through* them toward matching regions, but they never enter the result heap. The upper-layer greedy descent stays filter-blind: it only routes.
- **Adaptive ef widening.** The effective beam width is recomputed from the acceptance rate observed among evaluated nodes: `effectiveEf = clamp(ceil(k / rate), ef, efCap)` with add-one smoothing (`rate = (accepted + 1) / (evaluated + 1)`) and `efCap = max(ef, min(liveCount, 16 · max(ef, k)))`. When (nearly) every node passes, this stays at `ef` and the beam behaves like the unfiltered one; under selective predicates it widens toward the cap.
- **Termination.** The beam exits early only once the result heap holds `effectiveEf` *accepted* nodes and the nearest frontier candidate is farther than the worst of them. When fewer matching nodes than `effectiveEf` are reachable, the beam therefore explores the entire connected component. This is the deliberate trade: selective filters now spend latency (worst case O(liveCount) distance evaluations, the same trade hnswlib's filtered search makes) instead of returning under-filled, low-recall results. The contract stays "up to `k` results": a predicate matching fewer than `k` live vectors still returns fewer than `k`.

### Measured behavior
All numbers below are asserted thresholds from `FilteredSearchSelectivityTests` (seeded corpus: 2000 vectors, 32d, Euclidean, `m = 16`, `efConstruction = 200`, `efSearch = 50`, `k = 10`, 20 seeded queries; `SeededRandom` + `levelSeed` make data and topology deterministic). No latency figures are claimed — the acceptance comparison is made at the post-filter strategy's own candidate budget (the same `ef = 50` beam), with the graph-aware path's extra exploration bounded by the cap above.

- **~10% pass rate (200 matching):** fills `k` on every query; recall@10 vs. brute-force-filtered ground truth asserted ≥ 0.9.
- **~1% pass rate (20 matching):** fills `k` on every query; recall@10 asserted ≥ 0.9. Control assertion documenting the improvement: emulating the retired post-filter pipeline (apply the predicate to the 50 unfiltered beam candidates) yields fewer than `k` survivors on *every* seeded query — re-running the suite against the pre-addendum implementation shows it returning 0–1 results where the graph-aware path returns 10.
- **~0.1% pass rate (2 matching):** returns exactly the matching set on every query, ordered identically to the brute-force-filtered ranking (asserted as set and order equality).
- **Tombstone interplay:** a removed matching vector disappears from filtered results while the surviving match is still returned (asserted; liveness is checked before the predicate inside the beam).

### Consequences for this ADR
The "Approximate indexes may return fewer than k results under selective filters" consequence above no longer applies to `HNSWIndex`; it still applies to the quantized variants, which retain post-filter until they adopt the same beam.
